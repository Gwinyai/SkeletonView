# SkeletonView

An app loading effect similar to what Facebook after app launch. This skeleton view is taken directly from the App Launch Design section of the course [iOS 12 & Swift 4 - App Design, UI/UX and Development](https://www.udemy.com/app-design-uiux-plus-ios-development/). This project just serves as an example of a skeleton view. If you would like to learn step-by-step how it was made and if you would like to learn about other app launch strategies please visit the course.
